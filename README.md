Source of Information Analysing using power bi
**Project Overview and Value Proposition**
This repository houses the Source of Information Analysis Power BI report, designed to provide comprehensive insight into how data, traffic, or customer engagement originates. The primary goal of this project is to map and quantify the effectiveness of various acquisition channels, content strategies, or reference points that feed into a central system or dataset.
Understanding the "Source of Info" is critical for strategic resource allocation. By visualizing which sources deliver the highest quality, volume, or conversion rates, stakeholders can **Make data-driven decisions to:**
Concentrate budget on the most profitable channels (e.g., direct traffic vs. social media vs. paid search).
**Refine Content Strategy:** Identify which informational touchpoints (e.g., internal databases, external documentation, or user-generated content) are most relied upon by users.
**Improve Data Quality:** Pinpoint sources that introduce data anomalies or require better governance.
The core deliverable, Source of info.pbix, offers an interactive, multi-dimensional view of source performance.
**Data Model and Expected Metrics**
The Power BI data model aggregates transactional or activity data with a structured lookup table defining the categorical Source. This design ensures that every piece of data analyzed is attributed to its correct origin. The heavy lifting for this analysis is performed using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), which creates dynamic, comparable metrics across all identified sources.
**Key Analytical Focus Areas:**
**Source Contribution:** Metrics showing the percentage breakdown of overall volume or total transactions by each source (e.g., "Referral," "Direct," "Email Campaign").
**Quality & Conversion:** Calculating the conversion rate, success rate, or quality score associated with each source to determine its actual value, not just its volume.
**Time-Series Trends**: Tracking changes in source performance over time to identify emerging channels, seasonal effects, or the decaying effectiveness of older strategies.
Comparative Performance: Visualization of sources against key dimensions (e.g., comparing social media sources versus organic search results side-by-side).
**Key Deliverables and Findings**
The report is structured into several interactive pages, likely including a high-level channel performance dashboard, a quality deep-dive, and a timeline of source evolution. You must populate this section with your actual findings after reviewing the report. The examples below illustrate the actionable insights this report is designed to deliver.
**High-Quality Source:** Organic Search (Source ID 4) accounts for only 25% of total volume but yields a 12% conversion rate—the highest across all channels—demonstrating superior lead quality.
**Volume vs. Value Discrepancy: **The "Internal Referral" source provides 40% of the total volume, but its associated quality score is 15% lower than the median, suggesting a need for better internal data standardization.
**Emerging Trend:** Traffic from the new Social Media Platform X has quadrupled in the last quarter and now warrants dedicated investment, whereas traffic from legacy Platform Y has declined by 10%.
